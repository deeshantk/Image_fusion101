# ABOUT
This project is based on Discrete wavelet transform to collect all the important information from multiple images and combining them to a single image.

The resultant image is much more accurate and helps in reducing the amount of data.

Firstly, using Discrete wavelet transform, images are decomposed into wavelet coefficients which converts them into four metrics(size reduces to half). Then both decomposed images are fused together by appling mathematical operation. The resultant image is inverse Discrete wavelet transform(size gets double) to give the final image.

This final image can be again used as input to get desired resultant output image.
